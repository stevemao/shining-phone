shiningPhone.js is a jQuery plugin to show off your phone!

Usages
=============

After including JQuery, simply download and include shiningPhone.js. For example, let's consider adding the following just before your closing `</body>` tag:

`<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script>`

`<script src='scripts/shiningPhone.js'></script>`

With the brunt of the work done, now let's call shiningPhone by:

$('body').shiningPhone();

Options
=============

You can, as you wish, configure the phone by adding

var options = {

    phone: 'iphone',
    
    // In sec
    
    animateTime: 10,
    
    infinite: true
    
};

and call 

$('body').shiningPhone(options);

That's it folks!

### That's so great, let's rock!!!
